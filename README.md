# openMINDS Java library

openMINDS Java is a library to support the creation and use of openMINDS metadata models and schemas in your Java application, with import and export in JSON-LD format.

## How to contribute

The openMINDS metadata framework is an open-source project and community contributions are highly appreciated. If you want to contribute please follow our :arrow_right: [**contribution guidelines**][contribution-url].

This repository has two main branches: pipeline and main. The pipeline contains the code for building the Java library from the openMINDS schemas. The build process is triggered by changes to the schemas, and runs as a GitHub action. The resultant library is copied to the main branch.

General usage questions should be raised and discussed in our :arrow_right: [**community forum**][community-forum].  
Alternatively you can email us: `support@openmetadatainitiative.org`

## Funding and acknowledgements

The openMINDS metadata framework development started in the [Human Brain Project (HBP)][hbp-website], funded from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the Specific Grant Agreements [SGA-1 (No.720270)][hbp-sga1-doi], [SGA-2 (No.785907)][hbp-sga2-doi], and [SGA-3 (No. 945539)][hbp-sga3-doi]. 

The framework is further developed as part of the EBRAINS 2.0 project, funded from the European Union's Research and Innovation Program Horizon Europe under Grant Agreement [GA (No.101147319)][ebrains2-doi].

The framework also receives support from the [BigBrain Project](https://bigbrainproject.org/), funded by [HIBALL][hiball-url].

## Collaboration partners

The openMINDS metadata framework is closely collaborating with the [InterLex Project][interlex-dashboard] of the [SciCrunch Data and Resource Infrastructure][scicrunch-website] and the [KnowledgeSpace][ks-website] hosted by the [International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF)][incf-website].
